### Welcome to mvan231's Shortcuts Repo hosted on GitHub

If you don't know, the reason why this repo exists is because of the lag that was being caused by the RoutineHub server and dissatisfaction from users of my Shortcuts.

The speed and reliability of GitHub has helped to speed up the update checks that my Shortcuts are doing tremendously.

If you want some info about how I set this up, you can ask me or you can check out [my post over on r/Shortcuts](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/tbw5ya/updater_issues_withroutinehub_instagram_media/).
