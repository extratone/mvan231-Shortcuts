### Purpose
This shortcut was designed to help remind about holiday or special dates which you may want to disable your alarms to allow you to sleep in a bit longer.

### Setup
Make sure the calendar name in the Find Calendar Events action is set properly. Personally, I use the subscribed holiday calendar, which is called "US Holidays" in USA.

This is used to check if there is a holiday calendar event scheduled to happen 'tomorrow'

#### Automation Setup

This shortcut operates best when setup with an automation to check for holidays / special dates without user input.

To set this up, you can use a shortcut like Automation Control or Cron. You can also just as easily set it up to run in the evening. Recommend choosing 7 or 8 PM to run it.
